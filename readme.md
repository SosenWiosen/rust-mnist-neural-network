# Simple Rust Neural Network for classyfying digist from the MNIST dataset

Hi! My goal for this repo is to get some experience in Rust and ML. Here I will try to implement the Neural Networks
from [this excellent course](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/). At the point in time I'm writing this I'm not
yet sure If I want to keep the different version from the different chapters in this book as separate files or
separate branches. Also, the project structure may not be the best as this project will be mostly me experimenting
with Rust.
